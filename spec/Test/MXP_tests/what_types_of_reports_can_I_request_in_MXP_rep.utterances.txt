There are three types of expense reports:

- Travel: includes all expenses for trips that you take or organize for business purposes (e.g., business, sales, training travel);

- Non-travel: includes all other operational expenses (e.g., all CRM spend);

- CapEx: includes expenses that should be directly charged to specific CapEx project (can include travel and non-travel expenses).

Note:

- Do NOT mix travel and non-travel expenses.

- By default, the system charge to your cost center. If you need to charge expenses to another cost center (cross charge), see Charging Different/Multiple Cost Centers.

- All of these reports can include out-of-pocket and mileage expenses and credit card transactions.
