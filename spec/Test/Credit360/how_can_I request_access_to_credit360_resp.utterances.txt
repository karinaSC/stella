To access the system go to the website [https://abinbev.credit360.com](https://abinbev.credit360.com)

Credit360 is an SSO tool, this means that you *must access it from the ID used to access other company tools*.
For the first access, it is recommended to click on *Have you forgotten your password?*, then an email with your password will be sent to you and you will be able to login.
