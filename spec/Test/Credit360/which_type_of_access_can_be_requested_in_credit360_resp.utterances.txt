There will be three access levels plus an auditor:
*1. Logger:* can input only the initial incident information. Once the logger submits their report for investigation they can no longer make changes;
*2. Approver:* conducts the investigation. Completes the investigation portion of the process.  Can change data, add photos and documents , determine the root causes and corrective/preventative actions to complete the investigation.
*3. Final Approver:* Can review and close the investigation.  Responsable for closing the investigation does NOT close corrective/preventative actions.  The Final Approver can also re-open an investigation should new information become available or if changes need to be made.  
*4. Auditor:* Ability to go into the system and review data. The auditor cannot make changes to the investigation. The auditor can only see the incidents.

Users who have access to the group *Administrators* are those who have privileged access in the application.
